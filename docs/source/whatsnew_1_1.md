## Solution of SurgToolLoc Challenge
[SurgToolLoc](https://surgtoolloc.grand-challenge.org/Home/) is a part of [EndoVis](https://endovis.grand-challenge.org/) challenge at [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/) in Singapore. This challenge is divided into two categories:
1. Surgical tool classification
2. Surgical tool classification and localization

Team NVIDIA won prizes by finishing [third](https://surgtoolloc.grand-challenge.org/results/) in both categories, and recreated interesting core components of the solutions in MONAI tutorials. For more details about how to reproduce the solution, please see [the tutorials](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/competitions/MICCAI/surgtoolloc).
