class ComplexUnet(nn.Module):
    """
    This variant of U-Net handles complex-value input/output. It can be
    used as a model to learn sensitivity maps in multi-coil MRI data. It is
    built based on :py:class:`monai.networks.nets.BasicUNet`.
    It also applies default normalization to the input which makes it more stable to train.

    The data being a (complex) 2-channel tensor is a requirement for using this model.

    Modified and adopted from: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI

    Args:
        spatial_dims: number of spatial dimensions.
        features: six integers as numbers of features. denotes number of channels in each layer.
        act: activation type and arguments. Defaults to LeakyReLU.
        norm: feature normalization type and arguments. Defaults to instance norm.
        bias: whether to have a bias term in convolution blocks. Defaults to True.
        dropout: dropout ratio. Defaults to 0.0.
        upsample: upsampling mode, available options are
            ``"deconv"``, ``"pixelshuffle"``, ``"nontrainable"``.
