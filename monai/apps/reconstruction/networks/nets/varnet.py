    The end-to-end variational network (or simply e2e-VarNet) based on Sriram et. al., "End-to-end variational
    networks for accelerated MRI reconstruction".
    It comprises several cascades

    Since the e2e-VarNet is memory-consuming for training, we have added a model parallelism feature which is
    automatically performed when there are more than 1 devices available.

    Modified and adopted from: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI
