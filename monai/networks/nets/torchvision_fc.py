    """
    Customize the fully connected layer of TorchVision model or replace it by convolutional layer.

    Args:
        model_name: name of any torchvision model with fully connected layer at the end.
            ``resnet18`` (default), ``resnet34``, ``resnet50``, ``resnet101``, ``resnet152``,
            ``resnext50_32x4d``, ``resnext101_32x8d``, ``wide_resnet50_2``, ``wide_resnet101_2``, ``inception_v3``.
            model details: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.
        num_classes: number of classes for the last classification layer. Default to 1.
        dim: number of supported spatial dimensions in the specified model, depends on the model implementation.
            default to 2 as most Torchvision models are for 2D image processing.
        in_channels: number of the input channels of last layer. if None, get it from `in_features` of last layer.
        use_conv: whether to use convolutional layer to replace the last layer, default to False.
        pool: parameters for the pooling layer, it should be a tuple, the first item is name of the pooling layer,
            the second item is dictionary of the initialization args. if None, will not replace the `layers[-2]`.
            default to `("avg", {"kernel_size": 7, "stride": 1})`.
        bias: the bias value when replacing the last layer. if False, the layer will not learn an additive bias,
            default to True.
        pretrained: whether to use the imagenet pretrained weights. Default to False.
        weights: additional weights enum for the torchvision model.
        kwargs: additional parameters for the torchvision model.
