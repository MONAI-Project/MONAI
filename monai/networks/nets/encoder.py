    An abstract class defines inferfaces of backbones/encoders in flexible unet.

    implement all the abstractmethods in this class. A list contains a series relative
    information about networks should be returned, in case the encoder defines a
    series of network structures. For example, the efficient-net encoder implement 10
    basic network structures in an encoder. When calling a _get_encoder_name_string_list
    function, a string list ["efficientnet-b0", "efficientnet-b1" ... "efficientnet-l2"]
