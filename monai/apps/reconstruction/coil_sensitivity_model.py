class CoilSensitivityModel(nn.Module):
    """
    This class uses :py:class:`monai.apps.reconstruction.networks.nets.complex_unet` to learn
    coil sensitivity maps for multi-coil MRI reconstruction. Learning is done on the center of
    the under-sampled kspace (that region is fully sampled).

    The data being a (complex) 2-channel tensor is a requirement for using this model.

    Args:
        spatial_dims: number of spatial dimensions.
        features: six integers as numbers of features. denotes number of channels in each layer.
        act: activation type and arguments. Defaults to LeakyReLU.
        norm: feature normalization type and arguments. Defaults to instance norm.
        bias: whether to have a bias term in convolution blocks. Defaults to True.
        dropout: dropout ratio. Defaults to 0.0.
        upsample: upsampling mode, available options are
            ``"deconv"``, ``"pixelshuffle"``, ``"nontrainable"``.
